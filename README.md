# holbertonschool-low_level_programming

This repository contains all the projects that I worked on using C, my first programming language. 
The concepts that I learned with these include: variables, functions, conditions, loops, data types, 
strings, arrays, hash tables, input/output, pointers, memory allocation, libraries, linked lists, 
and recursion.
